# github-users

## Introduction

This is my first use of Express.js, Bootstrap and Async functions with APIs

## Objective

Initially I was hoping to clone the entirety of the search functionality for Github, so as a recruiter I could search people from this application with an email address or full name.

## Limitations

A limitation of the Github API is that I'm unable to access person information of Github accounts so searching by user-name was the final result.
