<h1>GitHub Search Project<h1>

<p>This is my first use of Express.js, Bootstrap and Async functions with APIs<p>

<p>Initially I was hoping to clone the entirety of the search functionality for Github, so as a recruiter I could search people from this application with an email address or full name.<p>

<p>A limitation of the Github API is that I'm unable to access person information of Github accounts so searching by user-name was the final result.<p>
